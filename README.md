# prison_mail_automation
A prototype for identifying similar incoming email queries from prison inmates' families and automate common answers

We will be testing a number of classification algorithms, including the following:
- Logistic Regression
- Naives Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
We will then switch to deep learning approaches including:
- LSTM
- RNN

The final choice will be based on classification accuracy.

Thereafter this project shifts to Airflow to help automate the use of templates to reply to emails.
